# Quote API Project
## Description
This project was created for practicing express.js and APIs as part of the Codecademy Backend-Engineer course. It uses a number of GET and POST requests that can be found in ``server.js``.

## How to use
- Download and extract the zip file and run ``npm install`` to install dependencies. 
- Run ``node server.js`` to start the server. 
- You are set to play with API requests. Go to ``http://localhost:4001/`` to view the site, or you can use a GUI such as postman. 

## Roadmap
- I would like to make this project work with Nodemon as dev dependency
- I would like to add additional routes for PUT and DELETE
- I may separate the Quotes router to it's own file.
